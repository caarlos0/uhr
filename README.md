I'm learning German and got to the part in where I should learn how to tell the time.

Germans have a rather different way of telling the time, so, to practice both numbers, time telling, days of week, etc, I built a simple "clock" (hence the project name) that tells current time in all forms germans usually do.

The code is hammered together, please don't hold me accountable for this.

## Is this accurate?

I mean, probably... if you speak german and want to take a look, I'll greatly appreciate it.
