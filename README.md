# Uhr ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I'm learning German and got to the part in which I learn how to tell the time.

Germans have some different ways of telling the time, so, to practice numbers, time telling, days of week, parts of the day and etc, I've built this simple "clock" (hence the project name, _Uhr_ is "clock" in German) that tells current time in some common forms Germans use.

The code was hammered together in a rainy Sunday, while studying, so, please don't hold me accountable for any of this.

## Is this even accurate?

I mean, probably... although if you speak German and want to take a look, feel free to do so.
Issues and PRs are greatly appreciated.
